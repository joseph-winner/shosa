                   <h4>SHOSA AT ONE YEAR</h4>
                <p class="wel-note">
                    Standard high school igorora old students association is 
                    an association that brings together old students of 
                    standard high school Igorora and has its headquarters 
                    in igorora town council ibanda district. 
                    SHOSA idea started in April 2020 an initiative that was 
                    brought by one of the colleagues a one Twinamatsiko 
                    Medard who happen to be one of the Old Students of 
                    Standard High school Igorora 
                    The initiative was welcomed by other members that 
                    called for the formation of interim Committee that 
                    would manage the association After successful 
                    meetings and consultations, a 13 member committee 
                    was formed that spearheaded mobilisation, 
                    constitution making, registration with the government, 
                    account opening among others.
                    On July 1st 2020, official recruiting of Members to Join 
                    SHOSA began and by the End of August 2020, SHOSA 
                    was was fully registered with URSB and ibanda district 
                    authorities as a working body and an Account Number 
                    in Centenary Bank was opened in its name as well.
                    SHOSA has since undertaken a wide range of activities 
                    including reuniting all old students, planning reunions, 
                    and running a welfare policy that incorporates saving 
                    and credit scheme, assisting members in times of 
                    loosing loved ones and supporting members with 
                    special functions. 
                    Today 1st July 2021 shosa marks its first anniversary. 
                    Its a memorable day in the existence of standard high 
                    school Igorora and in our lives as old students having 
                    the first ever old students body. 
                    I wish on behalf of the executive and on my own behalf 
                    to thank the founder members, the patron, my fellow 
                    old students both members of shosa and all old 
                    students in general for giving us the courage and trust 
                    to serve you all year around. Thank you for the 
                    embracing all the projects and commitment in terms of 
                    time and most importantly finance as we continue to 
                    recruit new members in SHOSA as an association and 
                    welfare policy for those who are already members.
